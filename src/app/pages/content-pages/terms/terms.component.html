                            infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing the rights of copyright holders. If you
                            believe your copyright or other intellectual property right is being infringed,
                            misappropriated, or otherwise violated by a user of the Services, or you believe such a

                        <p><strong>2.13. General Terms.</strong></p>
                        <p>2.13.1. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
                            jurisdiction or arbitrator to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the unenforceable
                            provision will be modified so as to render it enforceable and effective to the maximum
                            extent possible in order to effect the intention of the provision.</p>
                        <p>2.13.2. Notices. Afiye Corporation is located at 1900 Steward Street, Suite 600, Seattle, WA

                        <p>2.13.3. Amendments to The Agreement. We may update the Agreement, including these Terms, at
                            any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we will let you know either by posting the
                            updated Agreement on the Sites or through other communications. It is important that you
                            review the Agreement, including these Terms, whenever we update it or you use the Services.
                            If you continue to use the Services after we have posted an updated Agreement, you are
                            agreeing to be bound by the updated Agreement. If you do not agree to be bound by the
                            updated Agreement, then, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.13.9, you may not use the
                            Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue
                            all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
                        <p>2.13.4. No Waiver. Our failure to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement or any term
                            or condition herein by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to that
                            breach or subsequent similar or other breaches.</p>
                        <p>2.13.5. Assignment and Delegation. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations
                            under this Agreement. Any purported assignment or delegation by you shall be ineffective. We
                            may freely assign or delegate all rights and obligations under this Agreement, fully or
                            partially, without notice to you. We may also substitute, by way of unilateral novation,
                            effective upon notice to you, a Company for any third party that assumes our rights and
                            obligations under this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>2.13.6. Alpha and Beta Testing. The Services include any alpha or beta testing or other
                            evaluation or use of products and services, features, functionality, and all components
                            thereof (whether in final or pre-release form) that we may conduct ("Testing"). Except to
                            the extent otherwise provided in another agreement between you and the applicable Afiye
                            Company, your participation in any Testing and use of any data, content, information, or
                            other materials in connection with such Testing shall be subject to this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>2.13.7. International Matters. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Services Addendum,
                            each Afiye Company is controlled and operated from United States offices. We make no
                            representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in any particular
                            country or location. If you choose to access, view, or use the Services, you do so on your
                            own initiative and you are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent
                            local laws are applicable. No Services, including software, may be downloaded or otherwise
                            exported or re-exported in violation of any applicable law, rule, regulation, or export or
                            import control.</p>
                        <p>2.13.8. Governing Law.Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.13.9, you hereby accept and
                            submit to the personal jurisdiction of the applicable courts in accordance with this Section
                            2.13.8 with respect to any legal actions, suits or proceedings, and waive any jurisdictional
                            or venue defenses otherwise available. The International Sale of Goods Act (British
                            Columbia) and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
                            Goods, will not apply in any way to this Agreement or to the transactions contemplated by
                            this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>2.13.8.1. For Users Who Are Residents of the United States.This Agreement, any related
                            matters, and any Claims arising under or related thereto (whether for breach of contract,
                            tortious conduct or otherwise) will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal
                            arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Washington, without reference to its conflicts
                            of law principles. The exclusive jurisdiction for all Claims that you and the Afiye
                            Companies are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts of King County,
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>2.13.8.2. For Users Who Are Residents of Canada. This Agreement, any related matters, and any
                            Claims arising under or related thereto (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or
                            otherwise) will be governed by the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the laws of
                            Canada applicable therein, without reference to its conflicts of law principles. The
                            exclusive jurisdiction for all such Claims will be the courts of the City of Vancouver in
                            the Province of British Columbia.</p>
                        <p>2.13.9. Dispute Resolution. <strong>THIS SECTION 2.13.9 APPLIES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
                                PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND IS VOID WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW.</strong> This
                            arbitration provision shall survive termination of the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>2.13.9.1. Informal Negotiations**.** To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of a Claim,
                            you and the applicable Afiye Company agree to first attempt to negotiate any Claim (except
                            those Claims expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before
                            initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence
                            upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your personal home address, if
                            provided by you, with an email copy to the email address you may have provided to such Afiye
                            Company. If necessary, to preserve a Claim under any applicable statute of limitations, you
                            or the applicable Afiye Company may initiate arbitration while engaging in the informal
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>2.13.9.2. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver**. <strong>Subject to Section 2.13.9.3,
                                you and the Afiye Companies agree that any Claim between you and any Afiye Company or
                                Afiye Companies will be resolved</strong> solely by binding, individual arbitration and
                            not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.** This Section 2.13.9
                            is governed, in all respects, both procedurally and substantively, by the United States
                            Federal Arbitration Act. You and the applicable Afiye Companies agree that you are each
                            waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>
                        <p>YOU AND EACH AFIYE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR
                            ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
                            REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties' Claim is resolved through arbitration,
                            the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not
                            otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding (the two foregoing
                            sentences shall constitute the <strong>"Class Action Waiver"</strong>. If this Class Action
                            Waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 2.13.9 shall be null
                            and void.</p>
                        <p>SUBJECT TO THE ABOVE THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
                            REGARD TO CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
                        <p>If any other provision of this Section 2.13.9 requiring that Claims be brought only on an
                            individual basis and not on a class, collective, or representative basis, is determined to
                            be invalid or unenforceable with respect to any particular Claim, then that Claim shall not
                            proceed in arbitration but rather will be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction
                            subject to Section 2.13.8. If that happens, however, the arbitration provisions in this
                            Section 2.13.9 will still be fully enforceable as to all other Claims, which must be
                            resolved in arbitration on an individual basis. Any arbitrable Claims will be resolved
                            before non-arbitrable Claims, which the parties will jointly request to be stayed pending
                            the conclusion of arbitration.</p>
                        <p>2.13.9.3. Exceptions and Opt-Out. Nothing in this Section 2.13.9 precludes any party from
                            filing or participating in administrative proceedings before state, provincial/territorial,
                            or federal agencies to address alleged violations of law enforced by those agencies.
                            Further, to the extent a party would have to file a timely administrative charge or
                            complaint as a prerequisite to filing a Claim in court, the party must do the same before
                            submitting a Claim to arbitration under this Agreement. Upon receipt of a right-to-sue
                            letter or similar administrative determination, however, the Claim can only be resolved in
                            individual arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>This Section 2.13.9 also does not prevent any party from applying to a court of competent

                            listing Agent for such listing. Afiye may require that you provide proof you are the owner
                            of the subject property, or that you have an exclusive right to post or advertise the
                            listing (e.g., by requiring a copy of the listing agreement). If Afiye is unable to verify
                            that you are the homeowner or are the contracted, exclusive listing Agent, Afiye may remove
                            the listing at any time in its sole discretion.</p>

                            and authorized you to post the listing to the Afiye Services and doing so does not violate
                            any term of your agreement with, or legal duties owed to, the owner of the home;</p>
                        <p>(b) your broker has authorized you to post the listing to the Afiye Services and doing so
                            does not violate any term of your agreement with, or legal duties owed to, your broker;</p>
                        <p>(c) you have complied with all relevant laws, regulations, and policies, including those

                            ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS©; and</p>
                        <p>(d) you are only submitting information that you know to be true and accurate, and you will
                            update or remove your listing submitted to the Afiye Services immediately if you become
                            aware that information included therein is or becomes untrue or inaccurate.</p>

                            attacks or defamatory statements about other users, clients, customers or agents. Please
                            avoid controversial topics such as politics, race, religion, and sexuality.</p>
                        <p>2.5.4.2. <strong>Be honest.</strong> Only post information that you know is true and
                            accurate. Similarly, do not misrepresent your identity or your affiliation with another
                            person or entity. If you submit a review, your review must reflect your true and honest
                            opinion of and experience with the provider, product, or service you review, and you must
                            disclose any incentive you received for providing your review (e.g., if you received any
                            discount for providing the review or you are connected (e.g., through employment or familial
                            relationship) to the subject of the review).</p>
                        <p>2.5.4.3. <strong>Submit only what you have a right to submit.</strong> Do not submit or post

                            Do not submit information about real estate properties you do not own, unless you are
                            authorized to do so as the contracted, exclusive listing Agent for that property.</p>
                        <p>2.5.4.4. <strong>Respect privacy and confidentiality.</strong> Do not publicly post the
                            personal or private information of others or other peoples' contact information. This also

                            publicly disclose any confidential or sensitive information.</p>

                            address of listing Agents who submit listings to the Services).</p>
                        <p>2.5.4.6. <strong>No spamming.</strong> Do not post advertising, junk mail, spam, scams, or
